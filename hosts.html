    <h1>Web Hosting</h1>
    
    <h2><a href="http://bluehost.com">Bluehost</a></h2>
    <p>Bluehost offers a range of options as a web hosting platform. Their most basic plan is their basic plan which starts at $2.95/mo but it renews at $11.99/mo. Their basic plan offers 10 websites and is said to be ideal for 40k visits per month. Bluehost also offers 24/7 chat support and is rated a 4.1/5 by their customers.</p>
    
    <h2><a href="http://GoDaddy.com">GoDaddy</a></h2>
    <p>GoDaddy also offers multiple monthly plan options. Their most basic plan starts at $5.99/mo and then renews at $9.99/mo. This plan offers only 1 website. GoDaddy offers 24/7 support as well as 24/7 security monitoring on your website. GoDaddy is rated a 4.6/5 by their customers.</p>
    
    <h2><a href="http://HostGator.com">HostGator</a></h2>
    <p>HostGator also offers multiple monthly plans. Their most basic plan starts at $2.75/mo but then renews at a higher price which they don't make finding very easy but after some quick math I discovered that it costs $11.00/mo after the discounted price goes away. This plan offers 10 websites. THis plan only offers support as a chat only option, so there is no phone support offered but the support is said to be 24/7/365. HostGator doesn't display their reviews in the same style as Bluehost and GoDaddy, so who knows what the public opinion is on them.    </p>
    
    <h2>My Choice: <a href="http://bluehost.com">Bluehost</a></h2>
    <p>I think Bluehost would be the best choice because of what they offer at the price they offer it. The 10 website offering with the 24/7 support is a deal maker. HostGator offers the same thing for less, but wothout a large sum of positive reviews I just wasn't quite sold. Bluehost also has a more professional feel to their website which upped their appeal for me. </p>
