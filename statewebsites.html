    <h1>Review of State Websites</h1>
    
    <h2><a href="https://portal.arkansas.gov/" target="_blank">My Favorite: Arkansas</a></h2>
    <p>
       Arkansas' website is very pleasing to me. I think it is simple to navigate as well as a good looking website. The webiste loads quickly, which is great because there's nothing worse than a slow site. The website is very straight-forward, the search bar is right in front when you first load into the page and the navigation menu is nice, large, and simple. And to top it all off, it works seamlessly on big and small screen sizes.

    <h2><a href="https://portal.kansas.gov/" target="_blank">Kansas</a></h2>
    <p>
        Kansas' website is also very nice. It is simple to navigate around as the navigation menu is right on the top of the page when you first load in and the search bar is too. I like their color scheme of red (redish orange), white, and blue. However, it can be a little slow to load, especially when going from page to page within the site itself. For the most part it works well on big and small sccreens, but I did notice that on a smaller screen their "Elected Officials" section gets a little messed up visually.

    <h2><a href="https://www.maine.gov/portal/index.html"  target="_blank">Maine</a></h2>
    <p>
        I think Maine has a very nice and functionable website. But there is something that doesn't sit 100% right with me about it visually. It just isn't my favorite look. But with that said, it is very easy to navigate. It seems a little outdated with their "Maine's Covid -19 Response" section on their home page (dorks). Their website loads very fast. One thing in particular that I do like on their home page is their "Map It" section. This shows you where a lot of their public resources can be found within the state.

    <h2><a href="https://alaska.gov/" target="_blank">Alaska</a></h2>
    <p>
        Alaskas' website is precisely what I would expect from Alaska. It has a state website look to it, very straightforward to the point where it's almost bland. But I do like it. The simplicity makes it enjoyable. It's very simple to navigate and looks good on multiple screen sizes. It also loads very quickly. The blue and white color scheme works very well and makes for a pleasing looking website.

    <h2><a href="https://www.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx"  target="_blank">My Least Favorite: Maryland</a></h2>
    <p>    
    I'm not really a fan of Marylands website. I think the colors are nice and it's a decent looking website, but it almost seems like they attempted to make it too simple. I'm not  a huge fan of the navigation bar being on the right side and opened all the time (if you're on a large screen). It's also a scrollable navigation bar but that isn't easy to notice unless you go onto it and scroll. The search bar being right in your face when you load into the homepage is convenient though, as it makes it easier to navigate. It also works well on big and small screen sizes. Nonetheless, Maryland takes last place.
