<p><b>Allegro non molto</b></p>
<p>                
Frozen and shivering in the icy snow,<br>
In the severe blasts of a terrible wind<br>
To run stamping one’s feet each moment,<br>
One’s teeth chattering through the cold.<br>
</p>

<p>
    
<p><b>Largo</b></p>
<p>        
To spend quiet and happy times by the fire<br>
While outside the rain soaks everyone.<br>
</p>
<p>
                <p><b>Allegro</b></p>
<p>
To walk on the ice with tentative steps,<br>
Going carefully for fear of falling.<br>
  </p>      
<p>
 To go in haste, slide, and fall down to the ground,<br>
To go again on the ice and run,<br>
In case the ice cracks and opens.<br>
             </p> 
<p>
 To hear leaving their iron-gated house Sirocco,<br>
Boreas, and all the winds in battle—<br>
This is winter, but it brings joy.<br>

        <h2>Winter<br>(Concerto No. 4 in F Minor)</h2>
           
        <p>With Autumn, Vivaldi transitions to harvest celebrations and a lively hunt. The first Allegro movement conveys a cheerful, rustic festivity with dancing peasants celebrating a bountiful harvest. The violins create a sense of movement and joy as the peasants celebrate with wine and merrymaking. In the Adagio molto second movement, Vivaldi portrays the tired revelers resting after the celebrations, perhaps under moonlight, in a scene of calm and peacefulness. The final Allegro movement depicts the excitement of a hunt. Vivaldi uses quick, rhythmic phrases to mimic galloping horses, barking hounds, and the thrill of pursuit, capturing the energy of the hunt as it rushes through a countryside transformed by autumn colors.</p>
