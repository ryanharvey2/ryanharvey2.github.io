<p><b>Allegro non molto</b></p>
<p>                
Under the merciless sun of the season<br>
Languishes man and flock, the pine tree burns.<br>
The cuckoo begins to sing and at once<br>
Join in the turtledove and the goldfinch.<br>
</p>
<p>
A gentle breeze blows, but Boreas<br>
Is roused to combat suddenly with his neighbour,<br>
And the shepherd weeps because overhead<br>
Hangs the fearsome storm, and his destiny.<br>
</p>
<p>
    
<p><b>Adagio</b></p>
<p>        
His tired limbs are robbed of rest<br>
By his fear of the lightning and the frightful thunder<br>
And by the flies and hornets in furious swarms.<br>
</p>
<p>
                <p><b>Presto</b></p>
<p>
Alas, his fears come true:<br>
There is thunder and lightning in the heavens<br>
And the hail cuts down the tall ears of grain.<br>

        <h2>Summer<br> (Concerto No. 2 in G Major)</h2>
           
        <p>Summer shifts to a hotter, more intense atmosphere. The first movement, Allegro non molto, begins with a weary, almost sluggish feel as the heat presses down. The music illustrates the oppressive heat of the summer sun, where both nature and humans slow down under its force. This sense of stillness, however, is interrupted by bursts of speed in the Adagio e piano â€“ Presto e forte second movement, portraying a fierce summer storm on the horizon. The second movement shifts dramatically in tempo, mimicking lightning strikes and rumbling thunder as the storm builds. The Presto final movement captures the full force of the storm, fast and chaotic, evoking intense winds and rainfall as nature unleashes its fury.</p>
