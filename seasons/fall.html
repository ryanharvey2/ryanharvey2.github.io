<p><b>Allegro</b></p>
<p>                
The peasant celebrates with dancing and singing<br>
The pleasure of the rich harvest,<br>
And full of the liquor of Bacchus<br>
They end their merrymaking with a sleep.<br>
</p>

<p>
    
<p><b>Adagio molto</b></p>
<p>        
All are made to leave off dancing and singing<br>
By the air which, now mild, gives pleasure<br>
And by the season, which invites many<br>
To find their pleasure in a sweet sleep.<br>
</p>
<p>
                <p><b>Allegro</b></p>
<p>
The hunters set out at dawn, off to the hunt,<br>
With horns and guns and dogs they venture out.<br>
The beast flees and they are close on its trail.<br>
  </p>      
<p>
 Already terrified and wearied by the great noise<br>
Of the guns and dogs, and wounded as well<br>
It tries feebly to escape, but is bested and dies.<br>

        <h2>Autumn<br> (Concerto No. 3 in F Major)</h2>
           
        <p>With Autumn, Vivaldi transitions to harvest celebrations and a lively hunt. The first Allegro movement conveys a cheerful, rustic festivity with dancing peasants celebrating a bountiful harvest. The violins create a sense of movement and joy as the peasants celebrate with wine and merrymaking. In the Adagio molto second movement, Vivaldi portrays the tired revelers resting after the celebrations, perhaps under moonlight, in a scene of calm and peacefulness. The final Allegro movement depicts the excitement of a hunt. Vivaldi uses quick, rhythmic phrases to mimic galloping horses, barking hounds, and the thrill of pursuit, capturing the energy of the hunt as it rushes through a countryside transformed by autumn colors.</p>
