<p><b>Allegro</b></p>
<p>                
Spring has arrived with joy<br>
Welcomed by the birds with happy songs,<br>
And the brooks, amidst gentle breezes,<br>
Murmur sweetly as they flow.<br>
</p>
<p>
The sky is caped in black, and<br>
Thunder and lightning herald a storm<br>
When they fall silent, the birds<br>
Take up again their delightful songs.<br>
</p>
<p>
    
<p><b>Largo e pianissimo sempre</b></p>
<p>        
And in the pleasant, blossom-filled meadow,<br>
To the gentle murmur of leaves and plants,<br>
The goatherd sleeps, his faithful dog beside him.<br>
</p>
<p>
                <p><b>Allegro</b></p>
<p>
To the merry sounds of a rustic bagpipe,<br>
Nymphs and shepherds dance in their beloved spot<br>
When Spring appears in splendour.<br>

        <h2>Spring<br> (Concerto No. 1 in E Major)</h2>
           
        <p>Spring opens The Four Seasons with a sense of joy and renewal. The first movement, Allegro, bursts with energy, featuring trills and ascending lines that mimic bird calls, capturing the liveliness of the seasonâ€™s rebirth. Vivaldi uses light, playful melodies to depict brooks flowing and birds singing, blending the natural beauty of springtime into music. In the Largo e pianissimo sempre second movement, the pace slows, portraying a goatherd resting beneath a tree as his dog barks nearby, evoking a gentle scene of pastoral calm. The final Allegro movement closes with lively dance rhythms, celebrating the rejuvenation of life with shepherds celebrating in the fields.</p>
