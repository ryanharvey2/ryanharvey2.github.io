        The first website I looked at was <a href="https://www.montanaknifecompany.com/" target="_blank">Montana Knife Company.</a> I find MKC's website to be aesthetically pleasing and I think it functions very well. They use a nice black, white, and orange colorway that I think works well for their companies main audience which is outdoor sportsmen and women. I like that so much can be found on their homepage as you scroll down, you don't need to use the dropdown menu everytime. A good chunk of what they offer is shown on their homepage. I do really like their dropdown menu too though, you have to click it to get it to dropdown which I prefer over a hover menu. They have very good imagery on their website is well, very pleasing to the eye I'd say. As you scroll the website is broken up into nice sections. Sections for knives in stock, knives coming soon, a timer for their next knife drop, some of their apparel, and a little bit about MKC itself. The website is also broken up visually as the sections that have the products listed on the homepage are all white, which makes it easy to look and and easy to recognize. To break up the white sections they have dark sections in between which makes it easy to follow along with. They follow a similar style even when you click on a product to get more information on it. They have good product descriptions and great images that they put next to their feature descriptions. Their dropdown menu includes both words that tell you what their products are and images of products they are highlighting, that are new, or that are coming soon. The code looked to be clean and modern. They do use HTML5 elements. I didn't see any table elements specifically but I noticed a ton of div and block elements all throughout the code. Their code is so complex looking that it's difficult to even recognize what's going on. It's interesting being able to look at the code and recognize some of it. Overall I'm a fan of MKC's website as I think it functions well and find it visually appealing.

        The second website I looked at was <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Wisconsin.</a> This review might be bias as I'm a huge badger fan, but I'll try to keep it professional. I think Wisconsins website is quite good. Their color scheme perfectly matches their audience and school colors, which consist of a beautiful vibrant red and a wonderful white. When you first arrive at the site it displays nice image showing school spirit and has a call to action that states "Launch your future at UW" where the "UW" is a link that redirects you to a discovery page about the university itself. As you scroll through the homepage Wisconsin takes advantage of white space really well. Similar to MKC's website, the white space signifies a section that will hold information or a little description about something they offer, are proud of, or articles that pertain to UW students in some way. UW has multiple buttons throughout their homepage that act as CTA's. I like the hover effect that they have, as you hover over the red button with white text it turns into a white button with red text and a red border, which is pleasing and sticks with their red and white theme. UW's website has two navigation bars. Their primary nav bar is the second one on the site and I like the way it appears over the main photo. It sticks out nicely and doesn't look clunky because it doesn't have a solid background. It doesn't scroll down as you scroll and I also like that. Their secondary nav bar is at the very top and has that beautiful red as the background color with white text. Neither nav bars are dropdowns which I think is an intersting choice but not necessarily a negative. They also have their logo inline with their primary nav bar on the lefthand side of the page which looks stunning to say the least. They have a very solid footer as well, as it has lots of links under the titles "Popular," "Resources," and "Quick Links." One little thing that I really like is that under their "Our research solves mysteries and transforms lives" section on their homepage they have images with small descriptions of what the linked images will take you to. But as you hover over these images the description gets underlined from left to right and the image gets ever so slighly zoomed in on. I think that's a nice touch. They do use HTML5. Once again I didn't notice any table elements, but I very well could just be missing them because the code is so crazy to look at on the small little inspect window. They also use a lot of div elements, similar to MKC. They have a ton of links in their code too because of how many images have links attached to them and all the link options they have as buttons, articles, and just links within the nav bars and footer. Overall I'm a fan of their website. I think the color scheme looks good and fits the school as a whole.

        The third and final website I looked at was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ref=nav_logo" target="_blank">Amazon.</a> This is the website that I don't like, I wouldn't call it a terrible website because it clearly works since Amazon is an insanely large and successful company, but it's so cluttered. Amazon's website does not feel like website for one of the worlds largest companys. It looks kind of ugly to be completely honest. When you get to the homepage you're immediately bombarded with products that are either in their own square box alongside 3 other boxes with products or they span the length of the screen if they are similar products to each other. Their nav bar has 16 seperate options, and that's not including the search bar, cart, or anything to do with your account. I get they have an absurd amount of products but 16 options seems like a lot to permanently have on your nav bar. They also have a dropdown menu that has whole bunch of options too. I think their color scheme is nice, it would be more pleasing to look at if they didn't bombard you with products but they are a retail company so I can only diss that so much. They also have a gigantic footer that takes up more than my whole computer screen. This isn't necessarily a negative either but I don't love it being so large. They really actually have two footers, one that pertains to the Amazon store and one that shows all the other companies that Amazon owns that are equipped with links that refer you to those websites. The layout makes a little sense, I'm sure there is some reason behind having such a dense website that is organized in such a cluttered looking way. I think that if Amazon wanted a better looking website, they'd have it rolled out already. They do use HTML5. Once again, I didn't notice any table elements. A lot of div elements and a ton of href's as well due to the hundreds of links they have. Overall I'm not the biggest fan and think it could look better and be more easy to navigate, but I'm sure Amazon knows that.
